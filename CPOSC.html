  <article class="about">
    <p>The Central Pennsylvania Open Source Conference (CPOSC) is a one-day technical conference for open source users and developers. Presentations and sessions cover all aspects of open source, with talks ranging from novice to expert skill levels
      and featuring case studies, best practices, code-alongs and more. Join us for a day of meeting with and learning from your technology peers.</p>

        <h2>Why CPOSC?</h2>
        <p>Technology is evolving with unprecedented speed, which means it's more important than ever for those on the front lines of tech to gather, converse and share their experiences. CPOSC offers technologists passionate about open source
          technologies that very opportunity through presentations, panel discussions, lightning talks, informal designated conversation topic areas, and more.</p>

        <h2>Why Downtown Lancaster?</h2>
        <p>As Downtown Lancaster's arts, music, and dining scenes have garnered national recognition over the past decade, we firmly believe that the Lancaster tech scene is in the midst of its own big boom. By moving downtown beginning in 2016, we
          wanted CPOSC to be at the center of this tech explosion. As a bonus, it's an easy walk from the Ware Center to the CPOSC After Party at <a href="#">Tellus360</a> !</p>
      </div>
      <div class="expect">
        <h2>What to expect:</h2>
        <p>Since its start, CPOSC has featured experienced technologists speaking on a variety of open source topics, from introduction level to deep dives and from emerging technologies to those tried-and-tested. You can also find stories of lessons
          learned with OSS, as well as niche industries like open source hardware. There is something for everyone at CPOSC.</p>
